# Employee Database Seeding - Summary

## What was accomplished:

### 1. Created Employee Model (`/backend/src/models/Employee.js`)
- Comprehensive Employee schema with all the required fields from your data
- Includes personal information, address, employment details, performance metrics
- Authentication & authorization fields (password, role, permissions)
- Emergency contact information
- Automatic password hashing middleware
- Automatic employee ID generation
- Virtual field for full name
- Proper indexing for performance
- Instance and static methods for common operations

### 2. Created Employee Seed Script (`/backend/src/seedEmployee.js`)
- Standalone seeding script specifically for employee data
- Creates the Narendra Modi employee record with all provided data
- Connects to your MongoDB Atlas database
- Checks for existing records to prevent duplicates

### 3. Updated Main Seed Script (`/backend/src/seed.js`)
- Enhanced to seed both Customer and Employee data
- Combined seeding for easier database setup
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 4. Created Employee Verification Script (`/backend/src/verifyEmployee.js`)
- Utility script to verify employee data was seeded correctly
- Displays all employee information for verification
- Shows database statistics

### 5. Updated Package.json Scripts
Added convenient npm scripts:
- `npm run seed` - Seeds both customers and employees
- `npm run seed:employee` - Seeds only employee data
- `npm run verify:employee` - Verifies employee data
